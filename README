Fast Image Writer
=================

This tool aims to be a faster option than 'dd' when copying image files
to a char or block devices.

Why ?
=====
For some unknown reason, 'dd' is performing very bad in my Linux box, 
when writing a 3.5G image to a SDHC card (mmcblkX) it tooks like two
hours to perform it's job. 

This new tool makes sync writes to the device in blocks of 1M through
the specific Linux system call sendfile(). This syscall have less overhead
than common read()/write() mechanism and is doing the same work in 6 minutes.
